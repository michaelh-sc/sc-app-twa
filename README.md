# Sutta Central Android Trusted Web Activity App

Android app for accessing [https://suttacentral.net](https://suttacentral.net) using Trusted Web Activities (TWA)

Would prompt for install of Chrome if not installed, and performs the Use Offline feature well.

Needs submission to Google Asset Link in order to operate at full screen - see (https://blog.chromium.org/2019/02/introducing-trusted-web-activity-for.html)[https://blog.chromium.org/2019/02/introducing-trusted-web-activity-for.html]
